# EmberBurn Release Checklist

Use this checklist every time you cut a new version. Copy/paste the raw markdown into your commit message or PR description and check items off as you go.

---

## 1. Pre-Flight — Verify Before You Touch Anything

- [ ] **Working tree clean** — `git status` shows no uncommitted changes
- [ ] **On `main` branch** — `git branch --show-current` returns `main`
- [ ] **Pulled latest** — `git pull origin main` (org repo is source of truth — see
      the remotes table at the bottom; check `git remote -v` before assuming names)
- [ ] **Dependency audit clean** — `pip-audit -r requirements.txt --strict` passes.
      `PYSEC-2026-888` / `GHSA-mfpj-3qhm-976m` (opcua chunk DoS) are expected: no
      upstream fix exists, and it is mitigated in-process by `apply_chunk_limits()`.
      Ignore those two and **nothing else**. CI enforces this in `security-audit.yml`.

---

## 2. GHCR Image Link Verification

> **Why this exists:** In v3.9.0 we discovered a 403 Forbidden on every image pull.
> The Dockerfile `org.opencontainers.image.source` label pointed to a repo name
> (`Small-Application`) that doesn't exist on the Embernet-ai org — the org repo is
> called `Emberburn`. GHCR uses this label to link packages to repos. Unlinked
> packages default to **private**, causing 403 even though the repo itself is public.

- [ ] **Dockerfile `image.source` label** matches the org repo exactly:
  ```
  LABEL org.opencontainers.image.source="https://github.com/Embernet-ai/Emberburn"
  ```
  If this says `Small-Application` or any other name → **STOP and fix it**.

- [ ] **GHCR package visibility is Public** — verify at:
  https://github.com/orgs/Embernet-ai/packages → `emberburn` → Package settings
  If the package doesn't exist yet (first release), you must set it to Public
  immediately after the first successful workflow run.

- [ ] **Workflow `IMAGE_NAME`** in `.github/workflows/docker-publish.yml` matches:
  ```yaml
  IMAGE_NAME: embernet-ai/emberburn
  ```

---

## 3. Version Bump (replace `X.Y.Z` with new version)

All four locations must have the **same** version string:

| File | Field(s) | Example |
|------|----------|---------|
| `helm/opcua-server/Chart.yaml` | `version`, `appVersion`, `catalog.cattle.io/upstream-version` | `4.0.9` |
| `helm/opcua-server/values.yaml` | `emberburn.image.tag` | `"4.0.9"` |

- [ ] `Chart.yaml` — `version: X.Y.Z`
- [ ] `Chart.yaml` — `appVersion: "X.Y.Z"`
- [ ] `Chart.yaml` — `catalog.cattle.io/upstream-version: "X.Y.Z"`
- [ ] `values.yaml` — `tag: "X.Y.Z"`

---

## 4. EmberNET Template Alignment

> **Added in v4.0.9:** Verify alignment with the canonical EmberNET Helm chart template.

### 4a. Store Labels (The Big Four)

Verify all four labels exist on **pod template** AND **Service (webui)** objects:

| Label | Pod Template | Service |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| `embernet.ai/store-app: "true"` | - [ ] Present | - [ ] Present |
| `embernet.ai/gui-type: "web"` | - [ ] Present | - [ ] Present |
| `embernet.ai/app-name: "EmberBurn"` | - [ ] Present | - [ ] Present |
| `embernet.ai/gui-port: "5000"` | - [ ] Present | - [ ] Present |

> `app-name` became `"EmberBurn"` in v4.1.7 (was `"emberburn"` from `.Chart.Name`).
> Store-catalog lookup is case-insensitive so both resolve, but pre-4.1.8 instances
> in the field still emit the lowercase form.

### 4e. Tenant Labels — the silent-failure one

`.Values.tenantLabels` is injected by the dashboard at deploy time. A chart that
does not render it carries no `embernet.ai/tenant`, so its Services are filtered out
of every tenant-scoped view — visible to SuperAdmin, **invisible to the customer who
deployed it** — and POD SHELL returns 403. It looks fine from our side. Wired in
v4.1.9; verify it stays wired:

```bash
helm template t helm/opcua-server --set tenantLabels."embernet\.ai/tenant"=acme \
  | grep -c "embernet.ai/tenant: acme"   # expect 4 — pod template + 3 Services
```

- [ ] `tenantLabels` rendered on pod template **and** all three Services

### 4f. App Icon — must be an annotation, never a label

Kubernetes label values cannot contain `/` or `:`, so an icon URL or data URI is
only legal as an **annotation**. The dashboard reads it from pod annotations as well
as the Service; Service-only leaves node cards showing a generic glyph.

- [ ] `embernet.ai/app-icon` is an **annotation** on pod template **and** Service
- [ ] Its value is **not** an external URL — air-gapped clusters cannot fetch one.
      It is an embedded data URI from `emberburn.appIcon`; regenerate with
      `python scripts/build-chart-icon.py`

### 4b. Network Configuration

- [ ] `values.yaml` has `network.hostNetwork: false` (dashboard proxy requires ClusterIP networking)
- [ ] `deployment.yaml` has `hostNetwork` / `dnsPolicy` conditional block

### 4c. `_helpers.tpl`

- [ ] `emberburn.storeLabels` helper function exists
- [ ] Used in `deployment.yaml` pod template labels
- [ ] Used in `service-webui.yaml` labels

### 4d. Dashboard Integration

- [ ] Service name uses `{{ .Release.Name }}` directly (required for dashboard FQDN proxy routing)
- [ ] Service selector matches pod selector labels
- [ ] `gui-port` label value is a quoted number (`"5000"`)

---

## 5. Quality Gates

All must pass before committing:

- [ ] **Helm lint** — `helm lint helm/opcua-server` → `0 chart(s) failed`
- [ ] **Helm template** — `helm template test-release helm/opcua-server` renders without errors
- [ ] **Chunk-limit guard** — `python test_chunk_limits.py` → `12/12`. This is the
      CVE-2022-25304 mitigation; it monkeypatches a private python-opcua method, so
      a dependency bump can silently un-apply it. The test drives the *unpatched*
      library first, so it fails rather than passing vacuously.
- [ ] **Sparkplug B wire format** — `pip install amqtt && python test_sparkplug.py`
      → `15/15`. Asserts payloads are protobuf and **not** JSON, which is the bug
      that hid behind an import guard for the life of the project.
- [ ] **Docker build** (optional, CI handles multi-arch) — `docker build -t emberburn:X.Y.Z .`

---

## 6. Helm Chart Packaging (Automated)

> **As of v4.0.9:** The `release.yml` GitHub Actions workflow automatically
> runs `helm package` and `helm repo index` whenever `helm/**` files change
> on `main`. You no longer need to manually package or update `index.yaml`.
> The pipeline chain is: `release.yml` → commits `.tgz` + `index.yaml` → triggers `pages.yml` → deploys to GitHub Pages → Rancher picks up the update.

Manual fallback (only if CI is broken):

- [ ] **Delete old `.tgz`** — `Remove-Item emberburn-*.tgz`
- [ ] **Package** — `helm package helm/opcua-server` (run from repo root)
- [ ] **Regenerate index** — `helm repo index . --url https://embernet-ai.github.io/Emberburn/`
- [ ] **Verify `index.yaml`** — `version:` and `urls:` reference the new `.tgz`

---

## 7. Release Notes

> These two rules used to be stated as "add an entry for the version you are
> cutting" **and** "remove the entry for the version you are cutting", which cannot
> both be satisfied. The intent is that `RELEASE_NOTES.md` **lags one version
> behind**: it documents what has shipped, and the release in your working tree has
> not shipped yet. So when cutting `X.Y.Z` you write the entry for the *previous*
> release, not this one.

- [ ] `RELEASE_NOTES.md` top entry is the **previous** version — no entry for the
      version being cut
- [ ] `CHANGELOG.md` **does** carry the current version. It is not governed by the
      lag rule; it is the Keep-a-Changelog record and should be written as you go

---

## 8. Commit, Tag, Push

> **Check `git remote -v` first.** The remote *names* differ between clones. This
> clone has `origin` = the org repo and `upstream` = the personal fork, which is the
> reverse of what this section used to say. Go by the URL, not the name.

**Order matters, and it is not the order this section used to give.** The tag must
be pushed and the image must finish building *before* the chart bump reaches `main`,
because `release.yml` publishes the chart on push-to-main while `docker-publish.yml`
only builds on a `v*` tag. Pushing `main --tags` in one shot races them and can
publish a chart referencing an image that does not exist yet — that is what the
v4.0.9 ImagePullBackOff was. `release.yml` now hard-fails in that case rather than
shipping it, so getting this wrong costs you a red build instead of a broken deploy.

```bash
# 1. commit on a release branch, not directly on main
git checkout -b release/vX.Y.Z
git add .
git commit -m "vX.Y.Z: <short description>"
git push -u origin release/vX.Y.Z

# 2. tag it — this and only this triggers the multi-arch image build
git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m "EmberBurn X.Y.Z - <short description>"
git push origin vX.Y.Z

# 3. WAIT for docker-publish.yml to finish (~6 min), then confirm the image exists
gh run list -R Embernet-ai/Emberburn --limit 1
docker manifest inspect ghcr.io/embernet-ai/emberburn:X.Y.Z

# 4. only now merge to main — this triggers the chart publish
git checkout main && git merge --ff-only release/vX.Y.Z && git push origin main

# 5. sync the personal fork
git push upstream main --tags
```

- [ ] Committed on a `release/vX.Y.Z` branch
- [ ] Tagged `vX.Y.Z` and pushed the tag
- [ ] **Image build finished and image confirmed present in GHCR**
- [ ] Merged to `main` on the **org** repo (`Embernet-ai/Emberburn`)
- [ ] Pushed to the **personal fork** (`patrickryan01/Small-Application`)

---

## 9. Post-Push Verification

- [ ] **GitHub Actions (Docker)** — check Actions tab, `docker-publish.yml` triggered on `vX.Y.Z` tag
- [ ] **GitHub Actions (Pages)** — check Actions tab, `pages.yml` triggered on `index.yaml` change
- [ ] **Image pull** — `docker pull ghcr.io/embernet-ai/emberburn:X.Y.Z` succeeds (no 403)
- [ ] **GitHub Release** — create one on `Embernet-ai/Emberburn` for tag `vX.Y.Z`:
      ```bash
      gh release create vX.Y.Z -R Embernet-ai/Emberburn \
        --title "vX.Y.Z — <short description>" --notes-file <(...)
      ```
      Not optional. This was marked "if desired" and consequently skipped for every
      release between v4.0.7 and v4.1.10, leaving the Releases page eight versions
      stale while the tags and images were all published.
- [ ] **Helm chart** — `helm repo update` shows new version in Rancher catalog

### Post-Deploy Dashboard Verification

- [ ] **App appears in dashboard** — EmberBurn card visible in "Deployed Apps"
- [ ] **"OPEN" button works** — Opens Flask web UI in iframe
- [ ] **Web UI loads** — All pages (Dashboard, Tags, Publishers, Alarms, Config, Tag Generator) load
- [ ] **API endpoints work** — `/api/tags`, `/api/publishers` return data through proxy
- [ ] **OPC UA working** — Port 4840 accessible from other pods
- [ ] **Prometheus metrics** — Port 8000 `/metrics` endpoint returning data

## Quick Reference — Git Remotes

Names vary by clone — **always confirm with `git remote -v`**. In this working copy:

| Remote | URL | Purpose |
|--------|-----|---------|
| `origin` | `https://github.com/Embernet-ai/Emberburn.git` | Org repo — CI runs here |
| `upstream` | `https://github.com/patrickryan01/Small-Application.git` | Personal fork |

Older clones have these two names swapped, which is how the fork silently drifted
17 commits behind between v4.0.8 and v4.1.10.

---

## Quick Reference — Sidecar Proxy

**EmberBurn does NOT need the sidecar proxy.**
Server-rendered Flask app with relative URL paths. Proxy-aware middleware handles URL rewriting natively (since v3.5.8).
