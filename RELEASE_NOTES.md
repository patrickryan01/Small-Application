# EmberBurn Release Notes

## v4.1.9 — 2026-07-20

### The Icons Never Loaded, The Writes Never Worked, GraphQL And Sparkplug Never Started

Audited the chart against the EmberNET App Store contract — the one generated
from the dashboard Go source, not the docs. Found four gaps. Then went looking
at the app and found worse.

**Icons**

- **Root cause**: Every icon in this product pointed at
  `avatars.githubusercontent.com`. We ship into air-gapped clusters. There is no
  public internet. The tile has never rendered.
- **Fixed** `Chart.yaml` icon and the `embernet.ai/app-icon` annotation — both
  are embedded data URIs now. No network, no origin assumptions, no excuses
- **Fixed** `app-icon` being Service-only. Contract §9.5: it is read from pod
  annotations too, and Service-only leaves node cards showing a generic glyph
- **Root cause** (header logo): `base.html` reassigned `logo.src` in JavaScript
  on page load and theme toggle. The proxy rewriter matches `src="/` in markup,
  not `logo.src = "/` in a script — so the JS overwrote the rewritten path with a
  raw absolute one and killed the logo behind the dashboard proxy. Both
  assignments were dead code; same image in both themes
- **Fixed** the Google Fonts `@import` in `style.css`. Also unreachable
  air-gapped, which is why the type has been rendering in fallback fonts
- **Note**: `embernet.appIcon` defaulted to `fireball.png` — the Fireball
  Industries corporate shield, not the EmberBurn logo. Wrong brand on the tile
  even if it had loaded

**Tenant labels — the one that actually mattered**

- **Root cause**: `.Values.tenantLabels` was never consumed anywhere in the
  chart. The dashboard injects it at deploy (`store.go:1304-1315`) and we threw
  it away, so pods and Services carried no `embernet.ai/tenant`
- **Result**: Services filtered out of every tenant-scoped view
  (`services.go:226`) and POD SHELL returning 403. Visible to SuperAdmin, invisible
  to the customer who deployed it. Looks fine from our side. Broken from theirs
- **Fixed** — rendered onto the pod template and all three Services, declared in
  `values.yaml`

**The write path**

- **Root cause**: `write_callback` was only wired to
  `DataTransformationPublisher` by class-name match, so the REST publisher's was
  `None`. Every tag create, write and bulk-create from the web UI returned 501
- **Root cause** (stacked on top): `write_tag()` had no `return` statement.
  Callers branch on the result, so even after wiring it, every success would have
  reported as a failure
- **Root cause** (third one): `DELETE` cleared only the publisher cache, which
  `publish()` repopulated on the next update cycle. The tag came back in under
  two seconds while the API said `success: true`
- **Fixed** all three. The Tag Generator is a real feature now instead of a UI
  wired to nothing

**GraphQL**

- **Root cause**: `flask_graphql` pins `graphql-core<3`; `graphene` 3.x needs
  `graphql-core>=3.1`. They cannot coexist. GraphQL has been in the protocol table
  since day one and has never once started in a shipped image
- **Fixed** — ported onto graphene 3 with a plain Flask view over
  `schema.execute()`. No unmaintained middleman this time
- **Fixed** two bugs that would have broken it anyway: resolvers read
  `self.tags_data` when graphene passes the root value as the first arg, and
  `tag_metadata` was snapshotted before the server attaches it
- **Changed** GraphiQL to default off — its assets come from a CDN. The API does
  not

**Security**

- **Added** token-gated writes on `/api/*`. Reads stay open so the dashboard keeps
  polling; the pod injects the token into its own HTML so the iframe works with no
  login and no usernames. `security.uiWrites: false` drops the UI to read-only for
  internet-facing deployments while automation keeps writing
- **Added** OPC UA signing, encryption and username auth. Opt-in, off by default —
  turning it on breaks every anonymous SCADA client until it is reconfigured.
  Fails loudly at startup if half-configured instead of quietly serving plaintext
- **Fixed** CORS being open to every origin. Same-origin by default now

**Release safety**

- **Root cause**: the chart publishes on push-to-main; the image only builds on a
  `v*` tag. Release them out of order and you ship a chart pointing at an image
  that does not exist. That is what 4.0.9 was
- **Fixed** — `release.yml` now refuses to package unless `appVersion` matches the
  values image tag *and* `ghcr.io/embernet-ai/emberburn:<version>` is already
  published. Order is: push the tag, wait for the build, merge the chart bump

**Everything else**

- **Fixed** the `'REST API'` publisher key that could never match —
  `RESTAPIPublisher` stems to `RESTAPI`. UI showed "RESTAPI", icon fell back to a
  generic glyph, toggle always returned `success: false`. The map was duplicated
  in two methods, which is how one drifted
- **Fixed** publisher status being a one-time snapshot — the UI re-polled every 2s
  and re-rendered stale data, so toggles never appeared to do anything
- **Fixed** the Prometheus tag gauge hardcoded to `1` with a `# Placeholder`
  comment, and a histogram that was created and never observed
- **Fixed** `importTags()` posting to `/api/tags/import`, a route that has never
  existed
- **Fixed** absolute `/api/...` paths breaking behind the dashboard proxy — and
  the relative-path workaround, which was also wrong
- **Replaced** the four "Feature coming soon!" buttons on the Config page. Export
  Config and View Logs are real, backed by new `/api/config` (credentials
  redacted) and `/api/logs`. Restart and Import were deleted rather than faked —
  config is Helm-managed
- **Fixed** modal CSS living inline in one template, so every other page using
  `.modal-overlay` rendered unstyled
- **Added** `websocket-server` and `twilio` to requirements — both missing from the
  shipped image, so the WebSocket publisher and alarm SMS could never start
- **Fixed** `replicas` fighting the HPA on every upgrade, and a NetworkPolicy that
  silently killed Prometheus scraping by omitting port 8000
- **Removed** 19 non-chart files shipping inside the packaged chart, including
  three stale UTF-16 PowerShell error dumps from a machine that no longer exists
- **Added** `version.py` as one source of truth. `setup.py` had drifted to 4.0.7
  while the chart was on 4.1.3
**Sparkplug B — 15/15 protocols now actually run**

- **Root cause**: `SparkplugBPublisher` imported `sparkplug_b`. No such package has
  ever existed on PyPI and it was not vendored here, so the import guard caught the
  `ImportError` and disabled the publisher silently. It has been dead for the life
  of the project while the README counted it
- **Root cause** (second one): where it did build payloads, it published **JSON** to
  `spBv1.0/` topics. Sparkplug B is protobuf. No real consumer — Ignition, Chariot,
  HiveMQ — could have decoded a single message even if the import had worked
- **Fixed** — rewritten onto `pysparkplug`. The library owns protobuf encoding,
  `bdSeq`, sequence numbering and the NBIRTH/DBIRTH/NDEATH lifecycle, so the
  hand-rolled versions are gone rather than ported
- **Fixed** ints mapping to `Int32`, which silently wrapped any counter past 2.1
  billion. Now `INT64`
- **Added** device rebirth when a tag appears after startup, so the metric is
  declared in a DBIRTH before its first DDATA like the spec requires
- **Fixed** `paho-mqtt` being unbounded. `pysparkplug` requires `paho-mqtt<2`; a
  fresh install was resolving 2.x, whose changed callback API stops Sparkplug
  connecting. Same class of bug as the flask-graphql conflict
- **Added** `test_sparkplug.py` — stands up an in-process broker, sniffs the wire,
  and asserts the payloads decode as protobuf and **are not JSON**. Import checks
  would not have caught either original bug

**Dependency security audit**

- **Audited** with `pip-audit`. Pinned `click>=8.3.3` and `cryptography>=48.0.1` —
  neither imported directly, but an unbounded rebuild could resolve a vulnerable
  version
- **Known unfixed**: CVE-2022-25304 in `opcua` — unauthenticated DoS via unlimited
  unterminated chunks. Affects **every** version of `opcua` and of its successor
  `asyncua`, so there is nothing to upgrade to. The chart's NetworkPolicy keeps 4840
  inside the cluster and pod memory limits cap the damage at a restart. Documented
  rather than left to be discovered
- **Chart version**: `4.1.9`, appVersion: `4.1.9`
- Image tag: `ghcr.io/embernet-ai/emberburn:4.1.9`
- Helm chart: `https://embernet-ai.github.io/Emberburn/emberburn-4.1.9.tgz`
- Multi-arch build (amd64/arm64) via GitHub Actions on `v4.1.9` tag

---

## v4.0.8 — 2026-03-04

- **Moved** 9 documentation files from repo root to `documentation/` folder for cleaner structure
- **Added** `App_Integration_Guide.md` — comprehensive guide for Embernet Dashboard integration
- **Added** `GUI_DASHBOARD_TODO.md` — issue tracking and resolution documentation
- **Chart version**: `4.0.8`, appVersion: `4.0.8`
- Image tag: `ghcr.io/embernet-ai/emberburn:4.0.8`
- Helm chart: `https://embernet-ai.github.io/Emberburn/emberburn-4.0.8.tgz`
- Multi-arch build (amd64/arm64) via GitHub Actions on `v4.0.8` tag

---

## v4.0.7 — 2026-03-03

### Flux Mesh Integration — Auto-Discovery Annotations

- **Added** `flux.embernet.ai/*` annotations to all three Service templates (webui, opcua, prometheus)
- **Added** `flux:` values block to `values.yaml` with `expose`, `serviceName`, `port`, `roleAttributes`
- **Web UI** service exposed on the Flux mesh by default (`flux.expose: true`)
- **OPC UA** and **Prometheus** services opt-in via `flux.exposeOpcua` / `flux.exposeMetrics`
- Edge tunnel auto-discovers annotated services — zero per-site configuration required
- Aligns with [flux_operability.md](docs/flux_operability.md) specification
- **Chart version**: `4.0.7`, appVersion: `4.0.7`
- Image tag: `ghcr.io/embernet-ai/emberburn:4.0.7`
- Helm chart: `https://embernet-ai.github.io/Emberburn/emberburn-4.0.7.tgz`
- Multi-arch build (amd64/arm64) via GitHub Actions on `v4.0.7` tag

---

## v4.0.6 — 2026-03-03

### Helm Chart Enhancements & Template Improvements

- **Added** `embernet.ai/app-name` label to webui service for Embernet Dashboard integration
- **Added** `display-name` annotation, `device` label, and `imagePullSecrets` support to Helm chart
- **Updated** deployment template with improved label selectors and resource configuration
- **Updated** `NOTES.txt` with Embernet Dashboard onboarding instructions
- **Added** comprehensive Helm chart README documentation
- **Added** Helm chart alignment & phased implementation planning docs
- **Chart version**: `4.0.6`, appVersion: `4.0.6`
- Image tag: `ghcr.io/embernet-ai/emberburn:4.0.6`
- Helm chart: `https://embernet-ai.github.io/Emberburn/emberburn-4.0.6.tgz`
- Multi-arch build (amd64/arm64) via GitHub Actions on `v4.0.6` tag

---

## v4.0.5 — 2026-02-13

### Fix: Docker tags only from tagged releases

- **Fixed** Docker metadata to stop generating a `main` branch tag that raced with the versioned tag build
- **Removed** `type=ref,event=branch` and `type=ref,event=pr` from workflow metadata — only semver tags are generated now
- **Changed** `latest` condition to explicitly require a `v*` tag ref instead of `is_default_branch`
- **Result**: Pushing a `v*` tag now produces only `X.Y.Z`, `X.Y`, and `latest` — no more phantom `main` image
- **Chart version**: `4.0.5`, appVersion: `4.0.5`
- Image tag: `ghcr.io/embernet-ai/emberburn:4.0.5`
- Helm chart: `https://embernet-ai.github.io/Emberburn/emberburn-4.0.5.tgz`
- Multi-arch build (amd64/arm64) via GitHub Actions on `v4.0.5` tag

---

## v4.0.4 — 2026-02-12

### Cleanup: Remove broken releases, fix workflow triggers

- **Removed** old broken releases (v4.0.1, v4.0.2, v4.0.3) and their tgz files from the repo
- **Cleaned** index.yaml to only contain the current version
- **Docker workflow** now only triggers on `v*` tags and `workflow_dispatch` — no more branch pushes or release events causing racing builds
- **Note**: CodeQL "Push on main" and built-in "pages build and deployment" are GitHub repo settings — disable CodeQL in Settings > Code Security, and set Pages source to "GitHub Actions" in Settings > Pages
- **Chart version**: `4.0.4`, appVersion: `4.0.4`
- Image tag: `ghcr.io/embernet-ai/emberburn:4.0.4`
- Helm chart: `https://embernet-ai.github.io/Emberburn/emberburn-4.0.4.tgz`
- Multi-arch build (amd64/arm64) via GitHub Actions on `v4.0.4` tag

---

## v4.0.3 — 2026-02-12

### Fix: Workflow triggers causing image overwrites

- **Root cause**: Docker build workflow triggered on `push to main`, `v* tags`, AND `release published` — causing 3 simultaneous builds that raced and overwrote the working `latest` manifest with a broken one
- **Fix**: Stripped workflow down to only trigger on `v*` tags and `workflow_dispatch`. No more branch push or release event builds.
- **Chart version**: `4.0.3`, appVersion: `4.0.3`
- Image tag: `ghcr.io/embernet-ai/emberburn:4.0.3`
- Helm chart: `https://embernet-ai.github.io/Emberburn/emberburn-4.0.3.tgz`
- Multi-arch build (amd64/arm64) via GitHub Actions on `v4.0.3` tag

---

## v4.0.2 — 2026-02-12

### Fix: Image tag 4.0.1 never published — 403 on pull

- **Root cause**: Chart.yaml and values.yaml were bumped to `4.0.1` but no `v4.0.1` git tag was pushed, so no container image was built. GHCR returns 403 (not 404) for non-existent tags on public repos, making it look like an auth issue.
- **Fix**: Bumped all versions to `4.0.2`, will push `v4.0.2` git tag to trigger GitHub Actions multi-arch build
- **Chart version**: `4.0.2`, appVersion: `4.0.2`
- Image tag: `ghcr.io/embernet-ai/emberburn:4.0.2`
- Helm chart: `https://embernet-ai.github.io/Emberburn/emberburn-4.0.2.tgz`
- Multi-arch build (amd64/arm64) via GitHub Actions on `v4.0.2` tag

---

## v4.0.0 — 2026-02-12

### Major Release: Complete Helm Chart + Container Image

- **Breaking**: Major version bump to signal production-ready release
- **Helm Chart**: Packaged tarball with proper index.yaml for Helm repository
- **Container Image**: Multi-arch (amd64/arm64) build with working GHCR permissions
- **Workflow**: Cleaned permissions - no attestation features causing private package defaults
- **Chart version**: `4.0.0`, appVersion: `4.0.0`
- Image tag: `ghcr.io/embernet-ai/emberburn:4.0.0`
- Helm chart: `https://embernet-ai.github.io/Emberburn/emberburn-4.0.0.tgz`
- Multi-arch build (amd64/arm64) via GitHub Actions on `v4.0.0` tag

---

## v3.10.4 — 2026-02-12

### Fix: ImagePullBackOff / 403 Forbidden (Final Fix)

- **Root cause**: Workflow still had `id-token: write` and `attestations: write` permissions even though attestation step was disabled. GHCR treats packages with attestation permissions as "security-sensitive" and defaults them to **private** visibility on every new tag.
- **Fix**: Removed `id-token: write` and `attestations: write` permissions from workflow entirely. Only `contents: read` and `packages: write` remain.
- **Manual action still required**: Until GitHub fixes this behavior, new tags may still default to private. Set package visibility to Public at: `https://github.com/orgs/Embernet-ai/packages/container/emberburn/settings`
- Image tag: `ghcr.io/embernet-ai/emberburn:3.10.4`
- Multi-arch build (amd64/arm64) via GitHub Actions on `v3.10.4` tag

---

## v3.10.3 — 2026-02-12 ⚠️ FAILED

### Updates

- Clean release to verify attestation fix from v3.10.2
- **Result**: Still got 403 Forbidden - attestation permissions caused private package visibility
- Image tag: `ghcr.io/embernet-ai/emberburn:3.10.3` (requires manual public toggle)
- Multi-arch build (amd64/arm64) via GitHub Actions on `v3.10.3` tag

---

## v3.10.2 — 2026-02-12

### Fix: ImagePullBackOff / 403 Forbidden on GHCR (Again)

- **Root cause**: `actions/attest-build-provenance@v1` with `push-to-registry: true` creates a **separate SHA-tagged manifest** before the semver-tagged manifest. GHCR links the SHA manifest as a distinct image with private permissions, causing 403 when K8s tries to pull the semver tag that resolves to the SHA digest.
- **Fix**: Disabled attestation step in workflow. Attestations are useful for supply chain security but break GHCR image pulls.
- **Evidence**: Two manifests in GHCR for same digest - one with `sha256-...` tag (0 downloads, private), one with `3.10.2`/`latest` tags (1 download, works after manual public toggle).
- Image tag: `ghcr.io/embernet-ai/emberburn:3.10.2`
- Multi-arch build (amd64/arm64) via GitHub Actions on `v3.10.2` tag

---

## v3.10.1 — 2026-02-12

### Fix: ImagePullBackOff / 403 Forbidden on GHCR

- **Root cause**: `docker-publish.yml` metadata-action included `type=sha`, generating SHA-digest tags (e.g., `sha-02870d...`). When workflow was triggered by branch push instead of semver tag, only SHA/branch tags were pushed — no `3.10.0` version tag existed in GHCR, causing 403 on pull.
- **Fix**: Removed `type=sha` from `docker/metadata-action` tag rules. Only semver, branch, PR, and `latest` tags are now generated.
- Image tag: `ghcr.io/embernet-ai/emberburn:3.10.1`
- Multi-arch build (amd64/arm64) via GitHub Actions on `v3.10.1` tag

---

## v3.10.0 — 2026-02-11

### UI Fixes

- **Fixed**: Navbar logo showed broken Embernet image inside dashboard iframe. Replaced with `emberburn-chart-icon.png` — EmberBurn now uses its own branding, not the Embernet parent logo.
- **Fixed**: Dashboard showed "Loading tag data..." when 0 tags are running. Now shows "No tags configured".
- **Fixed**: Publishers, Alarms, and Config pages stuck on infinite loading spinner when accessed through the Embernet Dashboard iframe proxy.
  - **Root cause**: `api.js` used absolute path `/api` for fetch calls. The proxy URL rewriter in `publishers.py` only rewrites `text/html` responses — `api.js` is served as `application/javascript` so its paths were never rewritten. All API calls hit the dashboard host instead of routing through the proxy.
  - **Fix**: Changed `API_BASE` from `/api` (absolute) to `api` (relative). Browser resolves relative URLs against current page URL, which already includes the proxy prefix.
- Image tag: `ghcr.io/embernet-ai/emberburn:3.10.0`
- Multi-arch build (amd64/arm64) via GitHub Actions on `v3.10.0` tag

---

## v3.9.0 — 2026-02-11

### Fix: GHCR 403 Forbidden (Image Pull Failure)

- **Root cause**: Dockerfile `org.opencontainers.image.source` label pointed to `Embernet-ai/Small-Application` (non-existent). GHCR uses this label to link packages to repositories — unlinked packages default to **private**, causing 403 on pull.
- **Fix**: Corrected label to `https://github.com/Embernet-ai/Emberburn` (the actual org repo name).
- **Action required**: GHCR package visibility must be set to **Public** via org package settings after first successful build.
- Image tag: `ghcr.io/embernet-ai/emberburn:3.9.0`
- Multi-arch build (amd64/arm64) via GitHub Actions on `v3.9.0` tag

---

## v3.5.8 — 2026-02-10

### Feature: Proxy-Aware Static Asset Loading

- **Problem**: When loaded inside the Embernet Dashboard iframe via `/api/proxy`, CSS/JS/images failed to load because absolute paths (`/static/web/...`) resolved against the dashboard domain.
- **Fix**: Added `after_request` middleware in `publishers.py` that detects reverse proxy (`X-Forwarded-For` header) and rewrites all `href`/`src`/`fetch()` paths to route through `/api/proxy?target=http://PodIP:5000/...`.
- Direct access (no proxy) is unaffected — rewriting only activates when proxied.

---

## v3.5.7 — 2026-02-10

### Critical Fix: Server Killing Itself on Startup

- **Root cause**: Shutdown logic (`stop_all()`, `server.stop()`) was inside `_setup_transformation_callback()` instead of `shutdown()`. Called during init → Flask and OPC UA died immediately after starting.
- **Fix**: Moved all stop/shutdown code into `shutdown()` method where it belongs.
- Flask (5000) and OPC UA (4840) now stay alive after initialization.
- Added Troubleshooting section to `NETWORKING_GUIDE.md`.

---

## v3.5.6 — 2026-02-10

### Hotfix: "Launch UI" Proxies to Wrong Port

- **Root cause**: Dashboard picks the **first** `containerPort` for "Launch UI" reverse proxy. `opcua` (4840) was listed before `webui` (5000), so the dashboard proxied to OPC UA binary protocol → `connection refused`.
- **Fix**: Reordered ports in `deployment.yaml` — `webui` (5000) is now **first**.
- Added `CAUTION` block + multi-port example to `NETWORKING_GUIDE.md` Section 2d.

---

## v3.5.5 — 2026-02-10

### Hotfix: CrashLoopBackOff

- **Root cause**: Liveness/readiness probes targeted OPC UA port `4840`, which is slow to bind during container startup (tag loading, protocol initialization). K8s killed the container before OPC UA finished starting.
- **Fix**: Probes now target Flask web UI port `5000` (starts instantly, reliable liveness indicator).
- Liveness: `initialDelaySeconds: 45`, `failureThreshold: 6` (more startup headroom).
- **All container ports unchanged**: `4840` (OPC UA), `5000` (WebUI), `8000` (Prometheus) — industrial protocol data still flows on all ports.

---

## v3.5.4 — 2026-02-10

### Hotfix

- **Fixed**: `embernet.io/app-icon` label used emoji `🔥` which is not a valid Kubernetes label value (must be alphanumeric, `-`, `_`, `.`). Changed to `"fire"`.
- **Fixed**: Added `release: types: [published]` trigger to `docker-publish.yml` so GitHub Releases created through the UI fire the container build workflow.
- Chart version: `3.5.4`, appVersion: `3.5.4`
- Image tag: `ghcr.io/embernet-ai/emberburn:3.5.4`

---

## v3.5.3 — 2026-02-10
